# Cricket Player Performance Prediction  

## Overview  
This project focuses on predicting cricket player performance using match and delivery data. By analyzing historical data, the system identifies the **top 11 players** most likely to perform well from a given list of 22 players. The project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and predictive modeling to derive actionable insights.  

## Features  
- **Data Loading and Exploration:**  
  - Load and examine provided datasets: `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv`.  
  - Understand the structure, trends, and patterns in the data.  

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
  - Handle missing values and outliers.  
  - Transform and preprocess data for efficient model training.  

- **Player Performance Prediction:**  
  - Develop a machine learning model to predict player performance.  
  - Identify the top 11 players likely to perform better from a given list of 22 players.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.  
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning.  

## How It Works  
1. **Data Loading:** Load the `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv` files into a Python environment.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Perform cleaning tasks such as handling missing data and removing inconsistencies.  
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features that contribute to player performance, such as runs scored, wickets taken, strike rate, and economy.  
4. **Model Development:** Train a machine learning model using historical data to predict player performance.  
5. **Prediction:** Input 22 player names, and the model predicts the **top 11 players** most likely to excel.
